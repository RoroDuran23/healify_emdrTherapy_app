       - If you answer "No" to critical questions, you'll receive guidance not to continue the questionnaire.

       - If you answer "Yes" to all critical questions, you'll proceed to the Second Round.

    3. **Second Round of Questions**: The Second Round of questions delves deeper into your experiences and symptoms. You'll have the opportunity to provide more detailed information about your situation.

       - Answer the questions as accurately as possible, choosing the appropriate options, and using text boxes for additional comments as needed.

       - Once you complete this round, you'll initiate an animation.

    4. **Follow the Red Ball**: During the animation, focus on the red ball and describe any changes in your thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations.

       - The animation is designed to help you better understand your emotional responses.
